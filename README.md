# energia-hardware-msp430

This is the required Energia library dependencies for the MSP430 uC (the FR5739IDA) on the ASPS DAQ. This is the heater uC.

Install this by deleting the Energia/hardware/msp430 directory for Energia 17. Replace it with the content of this github, so `git clone https://github.com/ara-daq-hw/energia-hardware-msp430.git msp430`

This is **NOT** the firmware to actually run the uC. That is located in [energia_asps_heater](https://github.com/ara-daq-hw/energia_asps_heater).
